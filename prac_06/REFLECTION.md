# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have spent more time thinking through (and reading) questions before answering them.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to spend more time on understanding the concepts outside of classes (e.g., sets).

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am completing coursework on time, and have been watching almost all lecture videos.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change how I focus my study in this subject outside of classes to include more time learning key concepts from the week.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like to have some mock in class code review practice before having to review another student's code. While we have the
seminar (including an in class exercise) and lecture videos to provide the foundational understanding of this process, being able to actually practice
on mock code (individually or in small groups) and then discussing the approaches/terminology used would help ensure our feedback
is correct/in the right tone/focussed on the right things, and also in our peer's benefit.
