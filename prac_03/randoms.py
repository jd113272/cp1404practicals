# What did you see on line 1?
# Random numbers between 5 and 20.
# Smallest number that could be outputted was 5, and the largest was 20

# What did you see on line 2?
# Random numbers between 3 and 10, in intervals of 2 (i.e. 3, 5, 7 & 9)
# This line could not produce a 4 as this is only one number away from 3, not a multiple of 2.

# What did you see on line 3?
# Random float numbers between 2.5 and 5.5
# Smallest number that could be outputted was 2.5, and the largest number that could be outputted was 5.5
