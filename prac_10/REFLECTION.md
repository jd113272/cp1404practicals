# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy seemed to be about spot on half the time while it was way off (two to threefold) the other half of
the time.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimate accuracy for larger programs seemed to get worse during the course of the subject. Smaller tasks seem to
remain about the same.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that my estimation skills for small programs are quite strong, but I need to work on my estimation skills for
larger programs.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learned that I need to make sure my comments are meaningful, and not redundant/noisy. Also, I sometimes need to
pick better variable names that are in the problem domain.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learned that sometimes my approach to solving a problem is not the most efficient/correct approach, and to
closely watch docstrings and comments to ensure they are in 'imperative mood'.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review Prac 7](https://github.com/flynnchigeza/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

This was a good code review as I added in some constructive feedback (e.g.: what does 'p' mean? and These numbers feel a
bit 'magic') along with some notes of well done sections (e.g.:
Good use of variable naming & This is a really good main function, which provides a good overview of the program
itself). It also taught me a bit about when to convert to different data types, including when the variable is first
created.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review Prac 9](https://github.com/LiamSutton28/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

This was a good code review as I was able to check LiamSutton28's taxi_simulator main function, as requested ("your
taxi_simulator program looks pretty good (with a couple of minor suggestions/corrections)".) Not only this, but I also
was able to provide feedback on docstrings, which they had not asked about, and perhaps were not fully aware of.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would have some of the practicals specifically go back over concepts from earlier weeks (e.g., dictionaries) which are
mainly in a
coincidental form at the moment. This would be to make it easier to understand/recall key concepts going into the
assignments, and the final exam.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I completed the practicals on time each week, and was able to (almost always) follow the subject's teachings and style
guide.
