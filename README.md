# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

This repository represents my progression through the CP1404 subject, as well as improvements in the quality,
readability and cleanness of my code.

To have clean code:

- Only use while loops for indefinite iteration.
- Carefully consider naming to ensure it is meaningful, follows style conventions and avoid reusing reserved
  keywords/builtin functions.
- Refactor/design functions so they follow SRP, and can therefore be reused.
